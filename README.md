For this project, the [Codalab Semantic Evaluation Competition](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124)  was tackled on different levels of granularity with different technologies. The full dataset belongs to the company in charge of the competition, [Rewire](https://rewire.online/). 

All the scripts are able to be runned individually and will start the finetunning process of each model.
